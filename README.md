# PWM-Servo-Control-Project
This project involves the development of a PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) servo motor control system using the PCA9685 PWM controller. 
The system is designed to allow the control of two seperate servo motors, enabling users to control servo movement via key inputs or specific angle values.
The project includes the functionality of recording and saving servo movements in a CSV file for future analysis.
